PROJECT NAME: SAKLOLO: DISASTER MANAGEMENT WEBSITE 

Saklolo is a disaster management system that serves as a preparedness, response, and recovery aid for Filipinos. Users are able to post their own incident reports onto a feed, wherein reports from other areas can also be found. Through the website, users also gain information on disaster statuses and updates. We wanted to develop an accessible disaster management system that can reach a vast majority of Filipinos.
